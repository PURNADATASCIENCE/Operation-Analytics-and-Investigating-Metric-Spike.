Operational Analytics is a crucial process that involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations to identify areas for improvement. This analysis helps various teams, such as operations, support, and marketing, derive valuable insights from the data they collect.

One key aspect of Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes. This involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales. It is essential to understand how to investigate these metric spikes to answer such questions effectively.
